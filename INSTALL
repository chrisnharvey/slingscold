To install Slingscold from source, you need to compile it:

== Compiling from source ==

+ First, create a build directory and cd into it:
     mkdir build
     cd build
+ Then, we configure with CMake:
     cmake ..
     Here you can get some errors if you do not have all the dependencies.
     (see the PKGBUILD file or the debian/control file)
- Compile it:
     make
     You can use "make -j3" if you have a dual core processor. (this will make it faster)

== Execute Slingscold ==

- To run slingscold:
     ./slingscold

== Installing Slingscold ==

- As root, run:
     make install
     OR:
     sudo make install
